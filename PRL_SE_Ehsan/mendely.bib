We leverage distant supervision using relations from the knowledge base FreeBase, but do not require any manual heuristic nor manual seed list selections.

	MR: Meaning Representation

        
	open-domain (or open-text): learning to associate a MR to any kind of natural language sentence (Shi and Mihalcea, 2004; Poon
	and Domingos, 2009)

        
	SRL: Semantic Role Labeling, predicting semantic structure

        
	Lemma vs. synset : lemma is allowed to be semantically ambigous

        

        

        
Goal
	produce MRs of the following form: relation(subject, object)

        
	each component of the resulting triplet refers to 		a disambiguated entity (e.g. sense dismabiguation)

        
Resources

        
	WordNet \& ConceptNet : no link of knowledge to raw text  	 Wikipedia : raw text which entities are not grounded (?)
	Unambiguous Wikipedia
	Extended WordNet

        
Method

        
	1. SRL (exisitng model:SENNA)
	2. Disambiguation: lemmas must be converted into synset 			   (energy learning)

        
Step 2

        
	jointly capture semantic information between words, entities 		and combinations of those

        
	assign low energy values to plausible combinations(what 	combination?)

        
	2.1) learn "embedding" for each symbol(low dimensional vector)
	2.2)  Minimize "Semantic Matching Energy Function"

        
Multi-Task Learning

        
	MRs induced from text and relations between
	entities are embedded (and integrated) in the same
	space.

        
	--> learn to perform disambiguation on raw text (Wikipedia) by 		    using large amounts of indirect supervision and little 		    direct supervision.

        
	“Ambiguated” WordNet and “Bridge” WordNet	

        
Evaluation:

        

        
Questions

        
	We only consider sentences that match the following
	template: (subject, verb, direct object). (why ?)

        
	each of the three elements of the template is associated with a
	tuple of lemmatized words (i.e. a multi-word phrase).( what 		are these associated tuples)},

abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.},

Inference rules are extremely important in many fields such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence in general. Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris' Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus.},

@misc{Mehdad2012,
abstract = {Textual Entailment (TE) has been proposed as a generic framework for modeling language variability. The great potential of integrating (monolingual) TE recognition components into NLP architectures has been reported in several areas, such as question answering, information retrieval, information extraction and document summarization. Mainly due to the absence of cross-lingual TE (CLTE) recognition components, similar improvements have not yet been achieved in any corresponding cross-lingual application.
In this thesis, we propose and investigate Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) as a semantic relation between two text portions in dierent languages. We present dierent practical solutions to approach this problem
by i) bringing CLTE back to the monolingual scenario, translating the two texts into the same language; and ii) integrating machine translation and TE algorithms and techniques. We argue that CLTE can be a core tech-
nology for several cross-lingual NLP applications and tasks. Experiments on dierent datasets and two interesting cross-lingual NLP applications, namely content synchronization and machine translation evaluation, conrm the eectiveness of our approaches leading to successful results. As a complement to the research in the algorithmic side, we successfully explored the creation of cross-lingual textual entailment corpora by means of
crowdsourcing, as a cheap and replicable data collection methodology that minimizes the manual work done by expert annotators.},

The patterns are semantically typed and organized into a subsumption taxonomy. The PATTY system is based on efficient algorithms for frequent itemset mining and can process Web-scale corpora. It harnesses the rich type system and entity population of large knowledge bases. The PATTY taxonomy comprises 350,569 pattern synsets. Random-sampling-based evaluation shows a pattern accuracy of 84.7\%. PATTY has 8,162 subsumptions, with a random-sampling-based precision of 75\%. The PATTY resource is freely available for interactive access and download.},

abstract = {The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) electrophoretic mobilities of 128 strains of bacteroides belonging to 17 species, including three subspecies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and two subspecies of Bacteroides ruminicola, were examined. Amongst the pigmented bacteroides, the migration of this enzyme correlated well with recognized taxa, and only one strain, VPI 9085 was clearly different. Other species such as B. oralis, B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. pentosaceus, B. bivius, B. disiens and B. ruminicola were delineated by the combined use of MDH and glutamate dehydrogenase. Forty-three strains belonging to the 'B. fragilis group' differed from the above species in possessing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and reference strains as well as fresh isolates were assigned to the correct species by the mobility pattern of these two enzymes. Other properties of MDH such as the pH optima for the oxidation of malate or the reduction of oxaloacetate were of limited taxonomic value. However, the alkaline stability of this enzyme at pH 9, 10 and 11 clearly differentiates the saccharolytic from the non-saccharolytic species of pigmented bacteroides with the latter showing highly stable enzymes with a half life greater than 50 min.},
